# Movie Recommendation System [![Link to Project](https://img.icons8.com/ios-filled/50/808080/link.png)](https://project-6zdx.onrender.com/)


This project implements a **Movie Recommendation System** using machine learning techniques to suggest movies based on a user's selected movie. The system uses data preprocessing, content-based filtering (cosine similarity), and Streamlit for deployment. It pulls movie details such as genres, cast, and director information from a dataset, and presents the recommendations in a user-friendly web interface.


### Key Features:
- Personalized movie recommendations based on a selected movie.
- Similarity computation using **Cosine Similarity** between movies.
- Interactive interface built with **Streamlit**.
- Movie posters fetched from **TMDb API**.
- Tags for genres, along with cast and director information.

### Technology Stack

- **Python**: Main programming language for developing the system.
- **Pandas**: Used for handling the dataset and data manipulation.
- **Scikit-learn**: Utilized for vectorizing textual data (such as genres) and computing cosine similarity.
- **Streamlit**: Framework for building the interactive web application.
- **Requests**: Used for fetching movie posters from the **TMDb API**.
- **Pickle**: For saving and loading the preprocessed data and similarity matrix.

## Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie_recommendation_system.git
    cd movie_recommendation_system
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    The required libraries include:
    - `pandas` for data manipulation.
    - `numpy` for numerical operations.
    - `requests` for API calls to fetch movie posters.
    - `streamlit` for creating the web app.
    - `scikit-learn` for machine learning and cosine similarity.

3. **Prepare Data**:
    - The project uses pre-processed data stored in `movie_dict.pkl` and the similarity matrix `similarity.pkl`. These can be generated by running the data preprocessing steps (if you don’t have them yet).
    - Alternatively, you can upload the `movie_dict.pkl` and `similarity_pkl.pkl` files in the project directory.

4. **Run the application locally**:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app_v1.py
    ```

    The Streamlit app will start and open in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

## How It Works

1. **Select a Movie**:
   - From the dropdown, select a movie title that you'd like to get recommendations for.

2. **Movie Recommendations**:
   - After clicking the "Show Recommendation" button, the system will display the top 5 recommended movies based on similarity to the selected movie. For each movie, the following details are shown:
     - Movie Poster
     - Movie Title
     - Genres (displayed as colorful tags)
     - Cast (displayed as a comma-separated list)
     - Director (displayed as the director’s name)

3. **Cosine Similarity**:
   - The system calculates the cosine similarity between the selected movie and all others in the dataset based on features such as genres, cast, and crew.
   - The top 5 most similar movies are selected and displayed.


## Deployment

The application is deployed on **Render** and can be accessed via the following link:

<!-- [Movie Recommendation System on Render](https://project-6zdx.onrender.com/) --> 

- After launching the app, select a movie title from the dropdown.
- Click the "Show Recommendation" button.
- See the top 5 recommended movies with their details.


## 1. Data Preprocessing
- **Loading Data**: The dataset from Kaggle's TMDB movies is loaded and converted into a Pandas DataFrame for easier manipulation.
- **Handling Missing Data**: Missing values are handled by filling with default data or removing rows with critical missing fields.
- **Feature Engineering**:
  - **Genres**: The 'genres' column is transformed into a list format.
  - **Cast & Crew**: Key members (lead actors, directors) are extracted and stored as lists.
  - **Text Fields**: Movie overviews are cleaned for better analysis.
- **Vectorization**: Genres and keywords are vectorized using CountVectorizer or TF-IDF for similarity computation.

## 2. Filtering & Similarity Calculation
- **Cosine Similarity**: The similarity between movies is calculated using cosine similarity, measuring how close the feature vectors (genres, cast, crew) are to each other.
- **Similarity Matrix**: The similarity matrix is precomputed and stored using **pickle** to speed up future calculations.
- **Top Recommendations**: Based on the cosine similarity, the system suggests the top 5 most similar movies.

## 3. Improvisation & Enhancements
- **Customization & Personalization**: By considering additional features like keywords, directors, and cast, recommendations are made more relevant to the user's preferences.
- **Diversity**: Techniques ensure diverse recommendations by avoiding over-similar suggestions.
- **Efficiency**: Precomputing the similarity matrix and using **pickle** ensures faster computations. Dimensionality reduction can be applied to handle large datasets.

## 4. Enhancing User Interface & Experience
- **Streamlit UI**: The system is integrated with **Streamlit** to provide an interactive interface, enabling users to select a movie and receive recommendations instantly.
- **Genre Tags & Layout**: Genre tags are displayed with color coding, and cast and director names are formatted for a clean, user-friendly interface.
  

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how content-based recommendation systems work, focusing on movie recommendations based on similarity measures. The application allows users to explore related movies with an intuitive UI built using Streamlit.
